# Arkanoid Game

## Game Overview
Arkanoid is a classic arcade-style video game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must use it to bounce a ball into a field of blocks at the top of the screen. The objective is to destroy all the blocks by bouncing the ball off the paddle and into the blocks without letting the ball fall off the bottom of the screen.

## Game Features

- **4 Levels:** The game features four challenging levels, each with a unique layout of blocks. As you progress through the levels, the game becomes more difficult with additional obstacles and faster ball movement.

- **Points Accumulation:** Players earn points for each block they destroy. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by breaking as many blocks as you can.

- **Lives:** In this version of the game, players start with seven lives. You lose a life when you run out of balls to hit the blocks with. If you lose all your lives, the game is over.
