# MyChatApp Readme

## About
MyChatApp is a simple yet powerful chat application designed to provide a user-friendly communication platform. The application features three main screens: Log In, Register, and Chat. These allow users to create an account, log in, engage in chats, and log out at their convenience.

## Technologies Used
The application employs a comprehensive tech stack comprising:

- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the application's user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework that aids in creating responsive and mobile-first web pages.
- **JavaScript**: A programming language utilized for creating interactive elements.
- **React**: A JavaScript library used for building user interfaces or UI components.
- **Node.js**: An open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment.
- **MongoDB**: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.

## Getting Started
To activate the application, follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Installing dependencies**: after you clone this git repository to your local machine, under the project's "MyChatApp - web app" directory, you will find two subfolders, namely CLIENT and SERVER. For each of these folders, open a terminal (cmd) and run the command `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

2. **Starting the server**: Open a terminal in the SERVER folder and write the command `node MyServer.js` to activate the server.

3. **Starting the client**: Similarly, open a terminal in the CLIENT folder and run the command `npm start`. This will start the client application and the default web browser should automatically open the application. If it doesn't, navigate to 'http://localhost:3000' in your web browser.

## Important Note
Please note that the application might work slower at first, as it establishes a connection with a distant server. This does not imply a problem with the application. All responses might take a while to appear, so please be patient during this period.

## Application Overview
Upon successful login or account registration, users are directed to the chat screen. Here, they can participate in the chat, share ideas, and connect with other users. If the user wishes to end their session, they can easily log out from the application at any point.

Enjoy using MyChatApp and happy chatting!
